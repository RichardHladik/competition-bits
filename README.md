# competition-bits

This repository contains files I use in programming competitions and which
aren't contained anywhere else (particularly in the [ICPC notebook][notebook] of my team,
Tři nerdi). As of now, this means:
- contest environment tests (C++ and Python version, Python modules, computer performance tests)
- TODO: solution stubs and templates – "do brute force until time runs out", backtracking, …
- maybe: algorithms (such as Dijkstra, topological sort, …) which are not
  contained in [our notebook][notebook] due to their simplicity, but which
  still take several precious minutes to write
- links to complementary resources
